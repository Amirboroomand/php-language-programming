# php-language-programming
"ùó£ùóõùó£"  (ùó£ùóõùó£) is an interpreted, server-side programming language developed for web design, but it can also be used as a general-purpose language. As of January 2013, PHP has been installed on 244 million websites and 2.1 million web servers. This language was created in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf and is currently being developed by the PHP group. Originally, PHP was derived from the term Personal Home Page. But now this word is a recursive abbreviation of ùó£ùóõùó£: Hypertext Preprocessor meaning PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.  PHP codes are interpreted by a web server that has PHP software installed on it. The commands of this language can be placed directly inside the HTML codes. From version 4.3 onwards, the PHP language added the ability to support the command line interface to its features. This feature can be used to create non-web software or software with a graphical user interface.  PHP is free software released under the PHP license. This license is not compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) because it places restrictions on the use of the PHP header. PHP can be installed on most web servers. It can also be installed as a separate shell on almost all operating systems and platforms. All these uses are free.  29% of the security problems published by the National Vulnerability Database in September 2013 are related to the PHP language. These problems are mostly caused by the lack of use of proper methods by programmers. And while the technical problems that exist in the PHP language itself are very few. (23 problems in 2008, less than 1% of problems) Given that programmers make many mistakes, it has been suggested many times to include features for detecting security errors in the PHP language to report these errors to the programmer. Although such tools are being developed for the PHP language, these proposals have so far been rejected and these tools have not been added to the language.


#What You Should Already Know
Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:

.HTML
.CSS
.JavaScript

#What is PHP?
.PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
.PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language
.PHP scripts are executed on the server
.PHP is free to download and use

#PHP is an amazing and popular language!



#What is a PHP File?
PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code
PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML
PHP files have extension ".php"

It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!
It is deep enough to run large social networks!
It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language!


#What Can PHP Do?
.PHP can generate dynamic page content
.PHP can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
.PHP can collect form data
.PHP can send and receive cookies
.PHP can add, delete, modify data in your database
.PHP can be used to control user-access
.PHP can encrypt data

With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. You can output images, PDF files, and even Flash movies. You can also output any text, such as XHTML and XML.

Why PHP?
‚Äå.PHP runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
.PHP is compatible with almost all servers used today (Apache, IIS, etc.)
.PHP supports a wide range of databases
.PHP is free. Download it from the official PHP resource: www.php.net
.PHP is easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side

What's new in PHP 7
PHP 7 is much faster than the previous popular stable release (PHP 5.6)
PHP 7 has improved Error Handling
PHP 7 supports stricter Type Declarations for function arguments
PHP 7 supports new operators (like the spaceship operator: <=>)

#What Do I Need?
To start using PHP, you can:

Find a web host with PHP and MySQL support
Install a web server on your own PC, and then install PHP and MySQL


#Use a Web Host With PHP Support
If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.

Just create some .php files, place them in your web directory, and the server will automatically parse them for you.

You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.

Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.

#Set Up PHP on Your Own PC
However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:

.install a web server
.install PHP
.install a database, such as MySQL
.The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php




#PHP Online Compiler / Editor
With w3schools' online PHP compiler, you can edit PHP code, and view the result in your browser.


Example:

<?php
$txt = "PHP";
echo "I love $txt!";
?>

I love PHP!

#PHP Syntax

Basic PHP Syntax
A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:

<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>
The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".

A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My first PHP page</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>

</body>
</html>

Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

#PHP Case Sensitivity

In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

In the example below, all three echo statements below are equal and legal:

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>

Note: However; all variable names are case-sensitive!


Look at the example below; only the first statement will display the value of the $color variable! This is because $color, $COLOR, and $coLOR are treated as three different variables:


Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>";
echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "<br>";
echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>

 "Hello World";
 
 #Comments in PHP
A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

Comments can be used to:

Let others understand your code
Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code


PHP supports several ways of commenting:

Example

Syntax for single-line comments:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment
?>

</body>
</html>

Example

Syntax for multiple-line comments:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines
*/
?>

</body>
</html>

Example

Using comments to leave out parts of the code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;
echo $x;
?>

</body>
</html>


#Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables

In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:

Example
<?php
$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;
?>

After the execution of the statements above, the variable $txt will hold the value Hello world!, the variable $x will hold the value 5, and the variable $y will hold the value 10.5.


Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.

Note: Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


Think of variables as containers for storing data.


#PHP Variables


A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

.A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
.A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
.A variable name cannot start with a number
.A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
.Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

Remember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!

#Output Variables

The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.

The following example will show how to output text and a variable:

Example
<?php
$txt = "W3Schools.com";
echo "I love $txt!";
?>

The following example will produce the same output as the example above:


Example:

<?php
$txt = "W3Schools.com";
echo "I love " . $txt . "!";
?>

The following example will output the sum of two variables:

Example
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 4;
echo $x + $y;
?>

Note: You will learn more about the echo statement and how to output data to the screen in the next chapter.


PHP is a Loosely Typed Language

In the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.

PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.

In PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives an option to specify the data type expected when declaring a function, and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a "Fatal Error" on a type mismatch.

You will learn more about strict and non-strict requirements, and data type declarations in the PHP Functions chapter.

#PHP Variables Scope

In PHP, variables can be declared anywhere in the script.

The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.

PHP has three different variable scopes:

.local
.global
.static


Global and Local Scope

A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:

Example
Variable with global scope:

<?php
$x = 5; // global scope

function myTest() {
  // using x inside this function will generate an error
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>

A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:

Example
Variable with local scope:

<?php
function myTest() {
  $x = 5; // local scope
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

// using x outside the function will generate an error
echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>

You can have local variables with the same name in different functions, because local variables are only recognized by the function in which they are declared.

PHP The global Keyword

The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.

To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function):

Example
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
  global $x, $y;
  $y = $x + $y;
}

myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
?>

PHP also stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS[index]. The index holds the name of the variable. This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables directly.

The example above can be rewritten like this:

Example
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
  $GLOBALS['y'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
}

myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
?>

PHP The static Keyword

Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.


To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:


Example
<?php
function myTest() {
  static $x = 0;
  echo $x;
  $x++;
}

myTest();
myTest();
myTest();
?>


Then, each time the function is called, that variable will still have the information it contained from the last time the function was called.

Note: The variable is still local to the function.

#PHP echo and print Statements

With PHP, there are two basic ways to get output: echo and print.

In this tutorial we use echo or print in almost every example. So, this chapter contains a little more info about those two output statements.

PHP echo and print Statements

echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

The PHP echo Statement

The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo().

Display Text

The following example shows how to output text with the echo command (notice that the text can contain HTML markup):

Example
<?php
echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
echo "Hello world!<br>";
echo "I'm about to learn PHP!<br>";
echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";
?>

Display Variables

The following example shows how to output text and variables with the echo statement:

Example
<?php
$txt1 = "Learn PHP";
$txt2 = "W3Schools.com";
$x = 5;
$y = 4;

echo "<h2>" . $txt1 . "</h2>";
echo "Study PHP at " . $txt2 . "<br>";
echo $x + $y;
?>


The PHP print Statement
